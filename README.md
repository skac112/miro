# miro
Library for handling vector graphics with SVG support and some DSL goodies.

Miro is a library for handling vector graphics in an effective and expressive way, thanks to using Scala. It is designed for SVG in mind. As of today (2017-04-08) it is still on early stage and has only limited support for SVG, but this will change soonly.
It is partly inspired by Haskell's diagrams.
